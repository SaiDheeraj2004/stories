    <p class="para"> Hinduism is the largest religion in the Indian subcontinent, and the third largest religion in the world. Hinduism has been called the "oldest religion" in the world, and many practitioners refer to Hinduism as "the eternal law" (Sanātana Dharma).[1] Within this faith, there are four major traditions or denominations, namely, Vaishnavism, Shaivism, Shaktism, and Smartism.[2][3][4][5] There also exist a number of minor traditions, such as Ganapatism[6] and Saurism.

    The religion is a diverse system of thought with a wide variety of beliefs, and hence the concept of God, and the number of deities, rests upon the philosophy and the tradition that make up a devotee's adherence. The faith is described by some to be monotheistic, where all deities are believed to be forms of Brahman, the Ultimate Reality, as popularised by the Advaita philosophy.[7] It is also widely regarded to be polytheistic and henotheistic, though this is also considered to be a form of overgeneralisation.Hindu deities are the gods and goddesses in Hinduism. Deities in Hinduism are as diverse as its traditions, and a Hindu can choose to be polytheistic, pantheistic, monotheistic, monistic, even agnostic, atheistic, or humanist.[1][2][3] The terms and epithets for deities within the diverse traditions of Hinduism vary, and include Deva, Devi, Ishvara, Ishvari, Bhagavān and Bhagavati.[4][5][note 1]

    The deities of Hinduism have evolved from the Vedic era (2nd millennium BCE) through the medieval era (1st millennium CE), regionally within Nepal, Pakistan, India and in Southeast Asia, and across Hinduism's diverse traditions. <br> The Hindu deity concept varies from a personal god as in Yoga school of Hindu philosophy,[8][9] to thirty-three major deities in the Vedas,[10] to hundreds of deities mentioned in the Puranas of Hinduism.[11] Illustrations of major deities include Vishnu, Lakshmi, Shiva, Parvati, Brahma and Saraswati. These deities have distinct and complex personalities, yet are often viewed as aspects of the same Ultimate Reality called Brahman.[12][note 2] From ancient times, the idea of equivalence has been cherished for all Hindus, in its texts and in early 1st-millennium sculpture with concepts such as Harihara (Half Vishnu, Half Shiva)[13] and Ardhanārīshvara (half Shiva, half Parvati),[14] with myths and temples that feature them together, declaring they are the same.[15][16][17] Major deities have inspired their own Hindu traditions, such as Vaishnavism, Shaivism and Shaktism, but with shared mythology, ritual grammar, theosophy, axiology and polycentrism.[18][19][20] Some Hindu traditions, such as Smartism from the mid 1st millennium CE, have included multiple major deities as henotheistic manifestations of Saguna Brahman, and as a means to realizing Nirguna Brahman.[21][22][23] In Samkhya philosophy, Devata or deities are considered as "natural sources of energy" who have Sattva as the dominant Guna.[24]

    Hindu deities are represented with various icons and anicons, in paintings and sculptures, called Murtis and Pratimas. <br> Some Hindu traditions, such as ancient Charvakas, rejected all deities and concept of god or goddess,[28][29][30] while 19th-century British colonial era movements such as the Arya Samaj and Brahmo Samaj rejected deities and adopted monotheistic concepts similar to Abrahamic religions.[31][32] Hindu deities have been adopted in other religions such as Jainism,[33] and in regions outside India, such as predominantly Buddhist Thailand and Japan, where they continue to be revered in regional temples or arts.[34][35][36]

    In ancient and medieval era texts of Hinduism, the human body is described as a temple,[37][38] and deities are described to be parts residing within it,[39][40] while the Brahman (Absolute Reality, God)[21][41] is described to be the same, or of similar nature, as the Atman (Self), which Hindus believe is eternal and within every living being.[42][43][44]

    <h4>Cristians</h4>

    <p class="para">A Christian is a person who follows or adheres to Christianity, a monotheistic Abrahamic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. Christians form the largest religious community in the world.[11] The words Christ and Christian derive from the Koine Greek title Christós (Χριστός), a translation of the Biblical Hebrew term mashiach (מָשִׁיחַ) (usually rendered as messiah in English).[12] While there are diverse interpretations of Christianity which sometimes conflict,[13][14] they are united in believing that Jesus has a unique significance.[13] The term Christian used as an adjective is descriptive of anything associated with Christianity or Christian churches, or in a proverbial sense "all that is noble, and good, and Christ-like."[15] It does not have a meaning of 'of Christ' or 'related or pertaining to Christ'.

    According to a 2011 Pew Research Center survey, there were 2.2 billion Christians around the world in 2010, up from about 600 million in 1910.[4] Today, about 37% of all Christians live in the Americas, about 26% live in Europe, 24% live in sub-Saharan Africa, about 13% live in Asia and the Pacific, and 1% live in the Middle East and North Africa.[4] Christians make up the majority of the population in 158 countries and territories.[4] 280 million Christians live as a minority. About half of all Christians worldwide are Catholic, while more than a third are Protestant (37%).[4] Orthodox communions comprise 12% of the world's Christians.[4] Other Christian groups make up the remainder. By 2050, the Christian population is expected to exceed 3 billion.[4] According to a 2012 Pew Research Center survey, Christianity will remain the world's largest religion in 2050, if current trends continue. In recent history, Christians have experienced persecution of varying severity, especially in the Middle-East, North Africa, East Asia, and South Asia.

    <h4>Muslims</h4>

    <p class="para">In Islam, Allah (Arabic: ٱللَّٰه, romanized: Allāh, contraction of ٱلْإِلَٰه al-’Ilāh, lit. 'the god')[1] is seen as the creator and sustainer of the universe,[2][1][3][4][5] who lives eternally and will eventually resurrect all humans.[6] God is conceived as a perfect, singular, immortal, omnipotent, and omniscient god, completely infinite in all of his attributes.[1][3][5][7] Islam further emphasizes that God is most merciful.[8][9][10] The Islamic concept of God is variously described as monotheistic, panentheistic,[11][12] and monistic.[13]

    In Islamic theology, Allah's transcendental nature means that he cannot be compared to any natural entity or phenomenon. Consequently, Islam completely rejects the doctrine of incarnation and the notion of a personal god as anthropomorphic, because it is seen as a form of shirk (idolatry).<br> He is described in the Quran as follows: "[Allah is] the Creator of the heaven and the Earth. He has made for you from yourselves mates, and among the cattle mates; He multiplies you thereby. There is nothing whatever like unto Him, and He is the One that hears and sees [all things]" (42:11). Therefore, Islam strictly and categorically rejects all forms of anthropomorphism and anthropopathism of the concept of God.[14][15][16][17]

    The Islamic concept of tawhid (oneness) emphasises that Allah is absolutely pure and free from association with other beings, which means attributing the powers and qualities of Allah to his creation, and vice versa. In Islam, God is never portrayed in any image. The Quran specifically forbids ascribing partners to share his singular sovereignty, as he is considered to be the absolute one without a second, indivisible, and incomparable being, who is similar to nothing, and nothing is comparable to him. Thus, Allah is absolutely transcendent, unique and utterly other than anything in or of the world as to be beyond all forms of human thought and expression.[18][19] The briefest and the most comprehensive description of Allah in the Quran is found in Surat al-Ikhlas.[20]
